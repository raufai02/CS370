    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>Food waste is an avoidable problem that 
        results from inadequate resources put towards 
        getting leftover food to people who need it most. 
        We believe many people would be willing to 
        dedicate their time and energy to helping their 
        communities if we lower the information barrier, 
        create social incentives, and raise awareness of 
        food insecurity. 
    </p>
    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to reduce hunger and increase food sustainability in our communities.
